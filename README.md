# Project: Cloud Take Home Assignment

## Objective

AFerry is building a cloud native system to support ferry bookings. When a booking is made, it is published to an event stream. There is an external system that needs to be notified about new bookings, and exposes a RESTful endpoint to receive booking events.

Your assignment is to implement a function that is subscribed to these events and publishes `booking_completed` events to the external system.

## Submitting

- Clone the repo into the platform of your choice - you will only have read permissions on this repo
- Create a pull request for your changes against your own repo
- Email your point of contact at AFerry with a link to the PR

## Brief

You will implement the function that is subscribed to the event stream. The event stream contains events of different types, your function should publish `booking_completed` events to the external system.

The external system accepts these events in a format defined in the enclosed [JSON Schema](./external-service/schema.json). Your function will need to transform events from the stream into this format before publishing.

Infrastructure and build tools have been provided, so you can concentrate on the code for the function.

You are welcome to install any additional packages from NPM to help you complete the assignment.

## Tasks

- Implement the assignment using JavaScript or TypeScript. Under [src](./src) there are two entry points, `index.js` and `index.ts` - you must delete the one you don't plan to use for your code to build correctly.
- Your function should pick out `booking_completed` events and ignore other event types
- Your function should transform events into the format defined in the [JSON Schema](./external-service/schema.json)
- Your function should publish events to the [Mock Server](#mock-server)
- Your function should have 100% test coverage, by adding tests under [test](./test).
- File names for tests should end with `.test.ts` or `.test.js` to be picked up by the test runner.
- Anything under the `external-service` should be treated as such, no changes should be made in this folder

## Mock Server

A mock server is provided for you to publish events to. This can be started by running:

```
npm run start:server
```

The URL to publish to is available in your function via the environment variable `PUBLISH_URL`. Requests will receive a 200 response code when the request body passes validation. If the request body does not pass validation, the server will respond with a 400 response code and an explanation.


## Install

To install dependencies, run the command `npm install` from the project root.

## Build

To build your code, run this command:

```
npm run build
```

To build your code and watch for changes, run this command:

```
npm run watch
```

## Invoke / Debug

Running invoke or debug commands will invoke your function with a sample event, containing a number of records. This command won't work if your function hasn't been built by the relevant [build](#Build) command.

To invoke your function run:

```
npm run invoke
```

Alternatively you can debug your function in Visual Studio Code by setting breakpoints and using `Run > Start Debugging`.

## Test

To run all tests, run the command `npm run test` from the project root.

Test configuration is inside the [package.json](./package.json).

If you are using TypeScript, [TS Auto Mock](https://typescript-tdd.github.io/ts-auto-mock/) is included which allows you to create mock data from TypeScript interfaces. You don't have to use it, but it might be useful.

## Solution

The solution is coded in TypeScript and consists of a Lambda function that processes Kinesis stream events. The function filters for `booking_completed` events, transforms them to match the required JSON schema, and publishes them to an external system via a RESTful API endpoint. The key components of the solution include:

- **Event Parsing**: Each Kinesis stream record is decoded and parsed from Base64 JSON.

- **Event Filtering**: The function checks the event type and processes only `booking_completed` events.

- **Data Transformation**: The event data is transformed to fit the JSON schema required by the external system.

- **Validation**: The transformed data is validated against the JSON schema using `jsonschema`.

- **Publishing**: Valid events are published to the external system using Axios for HTTP POST requests.

- **Error Handling**: The function logs errors related to JSON parsing, missing data, validation failures, and network issues.

- **Testing**: The test suite uses Vitest to mock dependencies and verify that the function behaves correctly under various conditions, achieving 100% test coverage.
